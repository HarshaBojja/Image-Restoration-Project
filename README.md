Created an image restoration tool leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to repair and enhance damaged or low-quality images. 

The tool offers a seamless user experience, allowing users to easily upload images in need of restoration. Upon upload, the model analyzes the image and applies sophisticated algorithms to reconstruct and refine missing or degraded areas, resulting in a significantly improved visual output. To enhance user flexibility and customization, the tool provides various restoration options, including one-dimensional and two-dimensional techniques, enabling users to select the most suitable approach based on their preferences. 

The project showcases the power and potential of deep learning in addressing real-world challenges in image processing and enhancement, demonstrating remarkable improvements in image clarity, detail preservation, and overall quality.
